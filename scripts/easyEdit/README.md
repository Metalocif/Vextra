# ITB-Easy-Edit
 This is an Into the Breach mod loader extension by Lemonymous @ https://github.com/Lemonymous. It can either be used as a stand-alone mod, or integrated into mods using its features.
 
It intends to make it much easier for mod creators to do many things that were previously very difficult: The creation of new islands, tilesets, corporations, enemylists, etc. See the documentation for a full function list.
