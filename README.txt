VEXTRA
An Into the Breach Vek Mod By: Djinn, NamesAreHard, and Tatu
vBETA.0.2.0

We've heard your cries for more Vek, and we've delivered. Introducing "Vextra", the largest Vek mod created to date. With 5 new core Vek and 7 new unique Vek, Vextra provides a new opportunity. Vextra can be merged with the vanilla Vek, but Vextra also provides the same variety as Vanilla did (pre-AE) and can be played standalone, for a fully unique experience.

READ THIS PLEASE
Instructions for Use:
Modloader:
UPDATE: Modloader 2.8.1 or higher is required (you should always take the highest version when possible, we are updated to 2.8.2 as of writing this) for the mod to run. Download the latest Modloader Here: https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-ModLoader/releases
Installing:
Once installing the modloader, extract "Vextra" into your mods folder located in your Into the Breach directory.
Easy Edit:
Easy Edit should be embeded into this mod, but it's also version specfic in some ways so let us know if you have issues
Using the Mod In Game:
This mod utilizes Easy Edit (by Lemonymous) to get the Vek in game. There's three main tabs you'll want to use located with the Mod Content Menu.
Enemy Lists Editor:
The enemy lists tab contains a list of enemy lists that can be put onto islands as their spawns. You can either create your own custom list, or use the lists we've provided: "Vextra Only" and "Vanilla + Vextra". It also contains the "Finale" list, read below for more info on the Finale.
Note: Hitting the "Defualt" button at the bottom is a good way to make sure everything is as it should be.
Boss Lists Editor:
The same as enemy lists but with bosses.
Island Editor:
The island editor contains all 4 islands with their enemy list, boss list, mission list, and structure list. For each island, change their enemy list and boss list to the list that you would like to play with, whether that be Vextra only or the combined list. Once you've done this for all 4 islands, you're set.
If done correctly, Vextra Vek should now show up in game. If it doesn't, double check the island editor, and if it still doesn't, feel free to @NamesAreHard or @Tatu on the Into the Breach Discord (assuming we're still active).
Finale:
Currenlty for the finale, you have to make it yourself. In the enemy list editor, there's a list named Finale. Drag any Vextra Vek you'd like to see in the finale into that list and your solid.

Okay, you've read all that you have to read

List of New Vek:
Core:
Stinkbug- Has a basic melee attack, but puts gaseous smoke on either side of its attack that dissipates at the end of the Vek turn.
Isopod- Launches itself as an artillery shot, dealing damage as it bounces backwards from its target till landing on empty ground.
Mantis- Attacks two diagonal tiles.
Silkworm- Shoots a projectile forward while webbing backwards.
Antlion- Cracks the target, preparing to attack it and send the unit down a chasm. Burrows.
Unique:
Ladybug- Has a simple repulse, but has a hypnosis effect, damaging mechs that can attack it but don't.
Ice Crawler- Shoots a projectile that deals damage and then freezes. If the target is already frozen, it explodes the ice, dealing damage to adjacent tiles.
Dragonfly- Smoke the target, preparing to exploode the smoke, dealing damage with fire outwards in a cone shape. If there's no smoke, it damages and lights the target on fire. Flies.
Termites- Dashes through solid objects, leaving a rock in its place.
Cockroach- Shoots an artillery that self damages, but can revive at the end of the turn if it doens't get damaged again or stepped on.
Anthill- Deploys ants based on health; more health equals stronger ants.
Thunderbug- Damages its target and chains lightning to adjacent targets
