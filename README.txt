A Vek Mod By: Djinn, NamesAreHard, and Tatu
v0.0.0

We've heard your cries for more Vek, and we've delivered. Introducing "Vextra", the largest Vek mod created to date. With 5 new core Vek and 7 new unique Vek, Vextra provides a new opportunity. Vextra can be merged with the vanilla Vek, but Vextra also provides the same variety as Vanilla did (pre-AE) and can be played standalone, for a fully unique experience.
