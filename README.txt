VEXTRA
An Into the Breach Vek Mod By: Djinn, NamesAreHard, and Tatu
vBETA.0.1.0

We've heard your cries for more Vek, and we've delivered. Introducing "Vextra", the largest Vek mod created to date. With 5 new core Vek and 7 new unique Vek, Vextra provides a new opportunity. Vextra can be merged with the vanilla Vek, but Vextra also provides the same variety as Vanilla did (pre-AE) and can be played standalone, for a fully unique experience. 

Instructions for Use:
Modloader:
The modloader is required for the mod to run. Download the latest Modloader Here: https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-ModLoader/releases
Installing:
Once installing the modloader, extract "Vextra" into your mods folder located in your Into the Breach directory. 
Easy Edit:
We have to DISCUSS (maybe with Lemon) whether we can embed easy edit directly into the mod or if we need to instruct players how to do it seperatly. 
Using the Mod In Game:
This mod utilises Easy Edit (by Lemonymous) to get the Vek in game. There's three main tabs you'll want to use located with the Mod Content Menu. 
Enemy Lists:
The enemy lists tab contains a list of enemy lists that can be put onto islands as their spawns. You can either create your own custom list, or use the lists we've provided: "Vextra Only" and "Vanilla + Vextra". 
Boss Lists:
The same as enemy lists but with bosses. 
Island Editor: 
The island editor contains all 4 islands with their enemy list, boss list, and mission list. For each island, change their enemy list and boss list to the list that you would like to play with, whether that be Vextra only or the combined list. Once you've done this for all 4 islands, you're set.
If done correctly, Vextra Vek should now show up in game. If it doesn't, double check the island editor, and if it still doesn't, feel free to @NamesAreHard or @Tatu on the Into the Breach Discord (assuming we're still active).
